# Seismic-Assessment-of-Split-Foundation-Buildings-
Seismic Design and Analysis Using SAP2000
Dec 2024 â€“ May 2025 | Supervised by Dr. Putul

Designed and analyzed seismic-resistant structures using SAP2000, focusing on optimizing for both cost-effectiveness and structural safety.

Conducted seismic assessments and estimated inelastic response parameters for split foundation buildings in accordance with Indian Standards (IS codes).

Developed workflows for seismic design that integrated best practices for urban and critical infrastructure projects, ensuring compliance and practical resilience.

Enhanced proficiency in structural modeling, response analysis, and evaluation techniques for earthquake-resistant design.
